# Portfolio
A collection of projects that I've been involved in. I've predominantly coded within MATLAB, but there is also some python in here.

Not much to see here yet, but expect to see

1.PhD Code (MATLAB)
 -TI Sheet
 -TI Thread
 -TI Squeeze
    -May also include some old masters code if it's not as badly written as I remember.
    
2.Collab Code (MATLAB)
 -Astrophysics collaboration with J.Jenkins
    -Contains the MATLAB App I produced for the research group @UCL
 -Biology collaboration with the group
 -Code written to solve some metamaterials problem with Emma
 
3.Python
 -Few scripts based from a friends work that interacts with an API
 -Scripts from my Udemy courses.
